I am a fraud
Imposter Syndrome https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome

“Sometimes you know I really want people to just shut up and listen”

The suffering wasn’t because it was smaller than the goal. To realize great dreams you need great goals (...) It wasn’t suffering, it was a step toward a goal, no problem

WHy do you love me ?

I dont know. Seriously I dont know. I can say I love because of your beautiful eyes. But does that mean I will not love you if you wear spectacle ? I can say I can love you because of your character but does that mean I will not love you as you grow and change. Like Rumi said, if love were materialistic, love would fade away as we grow old.

there is currently syntax error in my life because of no matching brackets

Can I say something ?
Yes
Your style of working, your pride in doing it, your professional ethics and your intelluctal honesty is quite uncommon in the industry. And those that are uncommon are not immediately accepted in the society.
Everything in this world is ephemeral. Me, my style, my ethics, my honesty.

Final Chapter

Arul: One day, people are gonna say things about me. But no matter what they say, I hope you never believe them.

So you are quitting ?
I have to.
No you dont. This is a choice.
I am done here. I am not Neo and you are not Morpheus.
You walk out that door you better not come back.

Once a rat' always a rat
