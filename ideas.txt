I am a fraud
Imposter Syndrome https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome

“Sometimes you know I really want people to just shut up and listen”

The suffering wasn’t because it was smaller than the goal. To realize great dreams you need great goals (...) It wasn’t suffering, it was a step toward a goal, no problem

WHy do you love me ?

I dont know. Seriously I dont know. I can say I love because of your beautiful eyes. But does that mean I will not love you if you wear spectacle ? I can say I can love you because of your character but does that mean I will not love you as you grow and change. Like Rumi said, if love were materialistic, love would fade away as we grow old.
