Drums roll..

Straight motherf#^@ing ballin', part 2
Still ballin', Westside!

Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still ballin', ridin' on these niggas â€˜cause they lame
In a six-0ne Chevy, still heavy in this game
Can you feel me? Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga....

The stage was on fire. Aditya and his troop who called themselves 'Twisters' were dancing on the stage. Lets face it. Choreonite is the best day of the culturals. The loudspeakers have crossed the decibel levels. It did not feel like college anymore.  

Eleven years ago...

Few yards away from the stage where people can still talk and make one heard...

"I have cancer" said a guy
"Oh no", the girl looked at the guy pretending to be sad.
"Yeah"
"Sad"
"I hate that word. Sadness. Why cant one be happy ?"
"It's okay"
"You know I went to meet the doctor the other day. He said LBC is high in my blood and starting to spread like cancer"
"Hmm.. I have heard WBC count will be higher if I have cancer. What is LBC ?"
"Are you from medical college ?"
"Yeah"
"Dont you know ?"
"No" the girls voice toughened because she udnerstood the guy was playing around.
"Its called Love Blood Corpuscles. If I don't love often, it will spread and I will die"
"I feel like vomitting. Give me a minute. I ll be back"

The guy who was using these amateurish pick up lines was none other than Arul.

Arul turned at the stage and looked at all the cheering for Aditya. He loudly uttered "Blacky. Always running after fame."

Amidst the crowd, there were too many yelling for Aditya..

"He looks cute eventhough he is black"
"Yeah. But his eyes are in Nandhini"

Nandhini smiled. 

"Oh my god. Do you have a crush on him ?"
"Just a little"
