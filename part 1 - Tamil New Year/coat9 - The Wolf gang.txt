Few days after Tamil New Year...

In a crowded roadside teashop outside the company...

Good Morning Chennai. This is Radio Mirchi. Sema hot machi. Today we are going to talk about love confessions. Anyone can call and confess their love. You can say your name or you can remain anonymous.

There were a gang of 4 people standing little away from all the crowd with a cup of tea in their hands. It was scorching hot. Kathiri Veyil (hot summer) has onset very early. That did not stop the gang from performing their daily routine of having tea in their favorite teashop. Clearly one was telling a story. And everyone were listening to it. The man who was telling the story was Arulmozhi. And the gang called themselves Wolfgang.

"She was like a Rembrandt painting" Arulmozhi described
"What brand ?" his friend, David asked.
"Why not M.F Husaain ? You are an anti Indian", his friend Karim asked.
"J also can draw very nicely. Why not his painting ?" David again asked sarcastically.
"Leave me out of this" said J alias Jeremiah.

Arul: What makes a woman beautiful ?
J: Go die.
Karim: J, Let him got with the flow. You tell sweetheart.
